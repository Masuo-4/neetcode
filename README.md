# NeetCode Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the [NeetCode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). I use this repository to track my progress and improve my problem-solving skills in data structures and algorithms.

## Roadmap Overview
The NeetCode Roadmap provides a structured path to mastering coding problems across various topics, helping to build a strong foundation in algorithms.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by topics, reflecting the structure of the NeetCode roadmap. Each folder contains solutions to problems related to that topic.

```
- Arrays & Hashing
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Stack
- Binary Search
- Linked List
- Trees
```

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the corresponding folder for the problem category (e.g., `Arrays & Hashing`, `Trees`).
2. Open the Python file for the specific problem.
3. Visit the related problem page on the [NeetCode website](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).
4. Copy the content of the Python file and paste it into the NeetCode problem's solution editor.

### Example:

```bash
cd "Arrays & Hashing"
open problem_name.py
```

## Progress
I update this repository regularly as I solve more problems from the NeetCode roadmap. Each solution is implemented in Python.
